There are so many ways to build user interfaces. And with those ways comes tons of options to choose from regarding layout, spacing, typography, and color. It can quickly get overwhelming.

While there are component library all over the place, I wanted to build one for myself which follows a sepcific set of rules to avoid being overwhelmed with all the options.

These set of rules is called **Design System**.

Every CatalystUI component, block, and template follows this design system.

CatalystUI doesn't force you to follow this design system strictly. Please break the rules if you've a good reason to do so. Every component, block, template is highly customizable.

### What is design system?

A single source of truth to ensure all design and development teams are aligned.

You can also use this design system to build with AI like Lovable if you stuggle to generate good results with Lovable.
