### Typography

**Font Size**
Type scale is a simple and logical way to create a set of balanced font sizes that work well together.

Here are some popular type scales, ordered from smallest to largest:

- 1.067 – Minor Second
- 1.125 – Major Second
- 1.200 – Minor Third
- 1.250 – Major Third
- 1.333 – Perfect Fourth
- 1.414 – Augmented Fourth
- 1.500 – Perfect Fifth
- 1.618 – Golden Ratio

I am picking **1.200** as my type scale.
So here is our pre-defined font sizes rounded off for simplicity.

#### Typeface

Use two typefaces at most.

It's rarely necessary to use more than two, and it might make the design feel visually confused.

Use a single sans serif typeface for interface design, as they're generally the most legible, neutral, and simple.

I'll go with Inter from google fonts.

#### Font Weight

- Use regular and bold font weight only.
- Use bold for headings to emphasise them.
- Use regular for other small test.

### Spacing

Using limited, predefined, and consistent spacing options will also result in a neater, simpler interface design that's faster to build.

Use 8pt (8 pointer grid system). Many popular screen sizes are divisible by 8 and it provides a bit more spacing flexibility than using 10 point grid.

- xs: 8px
- sm: 16px
- md: 24px
- lg: 32px
- xl: 48px
- xxl: 80px

### 2 Shadow Options

You'll generally need only 2 shadow options (raised and overlay) to indicate the depth of interface elements.

### Border Radius

Create 3 border radius options (8px, 16px, and 32px) to use on small, medium, and large interface elements respectively.

### Use space to group related elements

Make outer padding the same or more than inner padding. Elements that are more related should be closer together.

The element inside a container are more related to each other than they are to the container itself.

- Place related element in same container.
- Space related elements closer together.
- Make related elements look similar.
- Align related elements in a continous line.

### Make horizontal padding twice the vertical padding in buttons

If you want people to recognise and element as a button, it's good idea to follow this pattern.

### Create a clear visual hierarchy

Present information in order of importance by making more important elements look more prominent.

This is my design system, I'll keep updating it and components as I learn more about building UIs.
